## Currently,
Volkswagen, renowned for its innovation, is proactively diversifying its product offerings to align with emerging trends, such as mid-sized SUVs and special-purpose vehicles. As part of this strategy, the NRG Program has been launched to drive unprecedented growth for Volkswagen of America (VWoA). A key focus of the program is to establish prioritized high-level business goals, ensuring that the company's initiatives are strategically aligned with the future market demands.

## However,
To address rising IT costs and inefficiencies, Volkswagen of America (VWoA) established the BPTO department, with Matulovic leading the initiative alongside a Project Management Office (PMO). Their efforts successfully realigned projects to stay within budget and timelines. This led to the implementation of a structured project prioritization process involving the Executive Leadership Team (ELT), PMO, IT Steering Committee, and the Digital Business Committee (DBC). However, limited funding later raised concerns about the overall effectiveness of the initiative.

## Now,
To what extent is the new project selection process deemed effective and indispensable? What strategic rationale underlies the allocation of $16 million in IT-controlled expenditures at Volkswagen?
